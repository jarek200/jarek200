 About Me: 
 
 I am a Full Stack Developer with expertise in the modern JavaScript stack, including React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. 
 I have designed and implemented robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitLab CI, Docker, AWS ECR, and ECS.
 Additionally, I have implemented AI technology to automate the creation of application documents, significantly reducing manual effort from 45 minutes to just 3 minutes per document.
 
🛠️ My career smoothly transitioned from aerospace development to full-stack software development, driven by continuous learning.
I leveraged my technical and analytical skills from aerospace to address the complexities of software engineering,
adapting my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail to excel in the dynamic tech landscape.
